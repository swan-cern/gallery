# Beam Dynamics

This is a gallery of basic example notebooks about beam dynamics. The library used is [PyHEADTAIL][pyheadtail]: click on the images to inspect the underlying document, open in SWAN the single notebooks or the full git repository!

[PyHEADTAIL][pyheadtail] is

- a python library to numerically simulate particle beam dynamics
- based on macro-particles to model collective effects of charged beams
- developed and maintained in the BE-ABP group at CERN

[PyHEADTAIL][pyheadtail] is used at CERN and other labs to study a wide range of collective effects in circular accelerators. It models beam interactions with wake fields and impedances, electron clouds, self-consistent space charge or realistic feedback systems, for instance. In particular, at CERN we use [PyHEADTAIL][pyheadtail] to study instabilities in all of the CERN synchrotrons in order to understand performance limiting mechanisms and to devise adequate mitigation schemes.
