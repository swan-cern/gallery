# Outreach

Reach out with SWAN! This section collect a series of outreach efforts involving SWAN.

## Particle open data teaching (Hiukkasfysiikan avoin data opetuksessa)

SWAN, the CERN Service for Web based ANalysis, is not only made for analysis of scientific data but also the ideal platform for outreach. Paavo Rikkilä (CMS) put together an introductory course about experimental HEP for future high school teachers. The result is great: check it out in SWAN!
